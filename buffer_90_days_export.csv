If I give all I possess to the poor and give over my body to hardship that I may boast, but do not have love, I gain nothing.” 
Paul said that without love, I am nothing -' all would be of no value, it would not save me. I would answer none of the great purposes which God has designed; I should not by all this secure my salvation. All would be in vain in regard to the great purpose of my existence. None of these things could be placed before God as a ground of acceptance in the Day of Judgment. Unless I should have love, I should still be lost. True Christian faith unites us to Christ, who is love. 

Paul continued to explain what Love looks like in 1 Corinthians 13:4-'8 when he said, ""Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-'seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

If we leave this foundation building to the “world” or our own nature, we will end up broken. So we must help our own children and the children of our church (and even the newer believers) build a strong foundation of faith.
